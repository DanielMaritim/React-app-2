# React-app-2

A simple React App using babel with JSX syntax as I learn how to use babel as a tool with React.js

It uses the babel cli 
```` 
<script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
````

Babel converts the ES6 code to a code which is compatible with the browsers.
